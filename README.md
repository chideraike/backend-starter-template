<h1 align="center">Backend Starter Template ⚡️</h1>

> Leaving a star ⭐️ would be greatly appreciated, don't just clone and go

## Overview
This is a starter template that I use whenever I want to make a backend project in python. Feel free to use the template, but at least **give me a star** so I know I'm doing something good for the community.

## Installation
After cloning the repo, run the following command on the project terminal to create the virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv backend-env
```
Then run the following command to install all the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
